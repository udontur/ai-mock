Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$. Define $(x - a)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mu_k x^k$, where $a$ is an integral constant. It is given that $\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} = \frac{-4}{3}$.
Chungchung claims that $n$ is an odd number and $a > 0$. Do you agree? Explain your answer.

Let $(bx - 6)^{2n} = \sum_{k=0}^{2n} \lambda_k x^{2n - k}$, where $b$ is an integral constant. If $\lambda_0 = \mu_n$ and $\lambda_1 = -4\mu_{n-1}$, find $a$, $b$ and $n$.

(a) Prove that $\sin \pi x^{2} + \sin 2\pi x - \sin \pi (x^{2} + 2x) = 4 \sin \pi (x^{2} + 2x)/2 \sin \pi x^{2}/2 \sin \pi x$.
(b) Find the least positive value of $x$ such that $\sin \pi x^{2} + \sin 2\pi x = \sin \pi (x^{2} + 2x)$.

Consider the curve Γ : $y = e^{-2x}$ , where $x \geq 0$ . Let $P$ be a moving point on Γ with $h$ as its $x$-coordinate, where $h > 0$ . Denote the tangent to Γ at $P$ by $L$ and the area of the region bounded by Γ , $L$ and the $y$-axis by $A$ . Prove that $A = e^{-2h} \frac{e^{2h} - 2h^{2} - 2h - 1}{2}$.

If $h = \ln (t + 1)$ , where $t$ is the time, find the rate of change of $A$ when $t = 2$ .

(a) Find Z x + sin x / (1 + cos x) dx.
(b) At any point (x, y) on the curve Γ , the slope of the tangent to Γ is 1 + x −cos x + sin x / (1 + cos x). Given that Γ passes through the point (\(\dfrac{\pi}{2}, 2 + \dfrac{\pi}{2}\)), does Γ pass through the point (\(\dfrac{3\pi}{4}, (\dfrac{3\pi}{4} + 2) \tan \dfrac{3\pi}{8} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\)).(7 marks)
